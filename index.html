         When not working, you’ll find me cultivating a vigorous spirit
         through the martial art of Kendo. Also, I enjoy spending time hanging
         out in the forest with my mountain bike and occasionally I snap a few
         photos. Above all, I enjoy spending time with my family at home. You may

    <div class="col-sm-9 col-md-8 col-xs-12">
        <p>I can proudly say I was the first on-board the marketing team of
          <a href="https://semaphoreci.com/">SemaphoreCI</a> and later helped
          build a well-rounded marketing team. My main job being product
          marketing. As it is often a case with startups, I've ventured in
          various business activities, from customer support, event management,
          sales to eve hiring.</p>
      <p>Fun fact: I was working part-time on making Semaphore before July 2014.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-9 col-md-8 col-xs-12">
      <p>Prognosis gave me my first chance of doing product marketing. Here I
        was working on developing two startup projects for a prominent Sweedish
        company — <a href="http://www.renator.net/">Renator AB</a>. The projects at hand were a localized social
        media platform and a cloud application for tour operators.
        My responsibilities included communicating with stakeholders,
        researching and prioritizing feature development, organizing work for
        the team and developing marketing strategies.

    <div class="col-sm-9 col-md-8 col-xs-12">
      <p>Dejan Marketing was the place where I learned the ropes on digital
        marketing. The clients I've worked on ranged from small companies to well established
        brands, such as Expedia. During this time I got got the opportunity to learn
        how to develop and implement online brand leverage tactics, how to
        acquire competition metrics, how to do website analysis and competition
        analysis, how to effectively write content and how to do the boring link building.</p>

      <p>My first job as an intern in a local retailer store. I was assigned to
      the marketing department and was involved in developing the companies
      online retail store. It was a really fun experience.</p>

      <p>After my internship, I was hired by a local marketing agency and found
        that working for an offline marketing agency can be a boring and a hectic experience.</p>

            <p>Few friends had a fun idea of developing an extreme sports
              hardware add-on, so we made our startup. Long story short we flopped, but learned a lot.
              Major stepping stones were the winning of StartEurope
              entrepreneurial event, finishing the hardware/software MVP, acquiring
              consultants from Europe and the USA  and getting to negotiate for an investment.
            </p>

            <p>If you're wondering why the project had ended, it's simple. It ended due to lack of a common vision by the founders, in other
              words, the team fell apart as we didn't share the same vision.
